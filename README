You need to register your app at developer.facebook.com/apps.
Set a canvas URL (which is the url where your app is hosted) [Usually the URL of your php script]
I decided to host on localhost.
The namespace becomes the URL at which your app is accessed
(
My namespace was sim_photodown and my app is accessed at : 
https://apps.facebook.com/sim_photodown/
)

Settings for the app
